# 🖥️ Full System Analysis Report (C:, D:, E:)
Date: 2025-12-08
Analyzer: GitHub Copilot

## 1. 🌐 Executive Summary
The user's workspace is distributed across three drives, each serving a distinct purpose in the digital ecosystem.
- **C: (System)**: The OS host, actively managed and optimized to prevent bloat.
- **D: (Library)**: The "Sanctuary" hosting the *Gongmyung Library* project (Philosophy/Code).
- **E: (Workshop)**: The "Engine Room" containing development tools, maintenance scripts, and mass data storage.

## 2. 🛠️ Drive E: The Workshop & Utility Belt
**Role:** Active Development, System Maintenance, Data Processing.

### 📂 Key Directories
- **`E:\Dev`**: The main coding workspace.
  - `AI_body_system`, `ai-collaborator`: AI-related projects.
  - `Gongmyung_Debug_Ship`: Likely a testing ground for the main library.
  - `EpicGames`, `Unity`: Game development engines moved here to save C: space.
- **`E:\Apps`, `E:\Data`, `E:\Models`**: Structured storage defined by `organize_e_drive.ps1`.

### 📜 Automation Scripts (PowerShell)
The user employs advanced PowerShell scripts to manage disk space and folder structures.
- **`organize_e_drive.ps1`**: Enforces a clean directory structure on E:.
- **`move_apps.ps1` / `optimize_c_drive_admin.ps1`**: 
  - **Function**: Moves heavy folders (Unity, Epic Games) from C: to E:.
  - **Technique**: Uses **Junction Points** (Symbolic Links) so the OS still thinks files are on C:, preventing breakage.
  - **Insight**: The user is power-user savvy, prioritizing C: drive health.

### 🐍 Data Analysis (Python)
- **`parse_chat_v2.py` / `temp_parse_chat.py`**:
  - **Function**: Parses large JSON chat logs (likely LLM conversation history).
  - **Workflow**: Batch processing (e.g., turns 1-20, 21-40) suggests handling massive datasets.

## 3. 📚 Drive D: The Sanctuary (Gongmyung Library)
**Role:** Intellectual Property & Philosophical Core.

### 🏛️ Gongmyung Library
- **Concept**: A "Resonance Library" blending code, philosophy, and economics.
- **Tech**: Custom Node.js server (No Express), File-system based routing.
- **Key Features**:
  - **`@flow` System**: Narrative code annotations.
  - **Gatekeeper**: Custom auth system.
  - **Underworld**: Economic model (Energy = Labor).
  *(See `Project_Analysis_Report.txt` for full details)*

## 4. ⚙️ Drive C: The Engine Room
**Role:** Windows OS & User Profile.

- **Status**: Actively kept lean.
- **User Profile**: `C:\Users\Owner` (Inferred from script paths).
- **Integration**: Many "Program Files" are physically located on E: but logically linked here.

## 5. 🤖 AI Agent Guidelines for this Workspace

### Navigation
- **Development**: Look in `E:\Dev` for active coding projects.
- **Reference**: Look in `D:\Gongmyung_Library` for core philosophy and patterns.
- **Maintenance**: Use scripts in `E:\` root for system tasks.

### Coding Style
- **PowerShell**: When writing system scripts, follow the pattern of `move_apps.ps1` (Error checking, `Test-Path`, Junction points).
- **Python**: For data tasks, assume JSON input and batch processing patterns.
- **Node.js**: In `D:\`, adhere strictly to the `@flow` narrative style.

### Caution
- **Junction Points**: Be careful when deleting folders on C: or E:. Ensure you are not breaking a Junction link that the OS relies on.
